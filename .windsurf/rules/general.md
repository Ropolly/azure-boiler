Ask Before You Act
If any requirement is unclear or you need specifics, ask a concise follow-up instead of guessing.

Respect Existing Structure
Never move or rename files/folders without explicit instruction.

Minimal, Focused Changes
Only generate what’s requested—no extra refactors or tooling unless asked.

Use Placeholders for Secrets
Don’t invent real keys or credentials; always stub with YOUR_…_HERE.

Adhere to Style Conventions
— Python: PEP8, snake_case, 4-space indents
— TS/React: Prettier defaults, camelCase for variables/components

Keep Comments Lean
Only comment non-obvious logic; avoid long prose explanations.

Provide Diffs or File Snippets
Show only the changed or new files, not the entire repo dump.

End with Next Steps
Summarize what you’ve done and ask if you should proceed further.
